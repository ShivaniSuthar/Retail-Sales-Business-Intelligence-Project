# Retail-Sales-Business-Intelligence-Project

This project analyzes a synthetic retail sales dataset to uncover insights that can guide business decisions aimed at maximizing revenue. Using SQL, Google Sheets, Excel, and Tableau, the analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) including sales performance, customer demographics, and purchasing trends. Insights reveal significant seasonal trends, customer spending patterns, and the impact of gender and age on purchasing decisions. The project includes recommendations for targeted promotions, seasonal discounts, and inventory management, with interactive Tableau visualizations to present findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Key Concepts: KPIs, Interactive Dashboard, Statistical Tests (t-test, welchâ€™s test, chi-square test), EDA
Technologies: MySQL Workbench, Tableau Public 2024, Google Sheets (Pivot table, VLookup, SumIf, Min/Max, Index, Match), Python (Jupyter Notebook, Scipy, Pandas), PowerBI
